# recnet-login
Requests-based [RecNet](https://rec.net) Login library for Python 3.8+

Forked from an older version of https://github.com/Jegarde/RecNet-Login to make it work with ReCaptchaV2

# Additional note
I am not providing any help or updates for this, as I deprecated this a while ago and couldn't be bothered to finish it
This also means it isn't completely finished and won't work 100% of the time
